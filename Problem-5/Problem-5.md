## BLOCKCHAIN ##
The code defines a simple implementation of a blockchain using a linked list data structure. It consists of two classes: Block and Blockchain.

### Run time complexity ###
1. The time complexity of displaying the blockchain is O(n), where n is the number of blocks in the chain.
2. The time complexity of validating the integrity is O(n), where n is the number of blocks in the chain. 

=> All operation take : O(n)

### Space complexity ###
1. If the blockchain contains N blocks, the space complexity of the linked list portion is O(N).

=> All operation take : O(N)
